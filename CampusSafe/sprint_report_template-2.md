# Sprint 2 Report 
Video Link: https://youtu.be/imiaE3GpHpU 
## What's New (User Facing)
We finished the remaining features that were on our “In Progress” on our kanban board. These features included incident notification, severe 
weather alert, and incident maps. While finishing all of the basic coding for all of our features we had to also find a platform where we 
could implement these features into an app where users would be able to interact with. So we were able to pick a template where we would put 
all of our features and implement them into this template to create a visual representation of a campus safe app. 



## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
We broke up the different parts with each team member. Gilad and Marissa worked on the remaining features of the app that still needed to be coded and created. Gavin, Julian, and Andrea worked on implementing the features that we finished in sprint 1 to a working template so that the different features have an illustration and are user friendly. We realized that we needed to be able to implement all of these features into a template so it can be put all together and not just lines of code that work individually. This mistake was realized and now we have been slowly trying to implement our features together where it would actually have different dropdown features such as report history, map illustration, and how to make a report. Also Julian worked on a full implementation of our app on a template where we had different tabs for different features

## Unfinished Work
We still have to do the integration of incident notification, severe weather alert, incident maps, and reporting an incident needs to be organized better in our dashboard. Currently we are still in the process of implementing the home page and user log in to the template that we have for our campus safe app. We are in the code review process for safety resources and are testing the emergency button to make sure that it performs exactly how it should be when integrated with our home page. So far we are still trying to implement multiple features that only have the basic coding into our template and have all of the functions be able to work together.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
 * We have a working app now
 * Features from last sprint have been fully implemented into the app
 * We know what we need to do for the next sprint

 
   
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Account functionality
   * overall cleanliness/visual experience
   * report process flow (pending)

Here's what did not go well
  * The notification part of the app is hard to get to work on computers
  * We had issues getting a app interface at the beginning
  * Issues assigning work for this sprint

  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * Polishing up the app and making it look consistent and good
   * Working on some more features for the app
   * Making sure everything works together
